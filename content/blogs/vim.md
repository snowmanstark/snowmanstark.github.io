It all started when I left my comfort zone in Windows to RHEL back in 2017 out of sheer curiosity and the thrill of continous challenges involved in using a Linux distro as my daily driver. The GUI helped me in getting around but editing basic files like .bashrc, etc for customizing the environment was getting tedious as I always had to open up the file in gedit. It worked but wasn't made to do editing stuff fast, that's when I was introduced to Vim by a college senior.

## The baby steps
Getting along with Vim initially was somewhat daunting. First place where almost all Vim beginners get stuck is exiting Vim and it was the same problem for me too, and that's when I googled my way out. To some extent it was a somewhat a smooth journey since then but I was highly restriced to the following commands `i`, `dd`, `yy`, `o`, `p`, `h`, `j`, `k` and  `l`. 

Then after many boring months I came to know about searching through the document and it was like "Eureka! I have found a treasure!". Even then I only knew just how to get to the next search instance (using `n`) and no idea on getting to the previous search instance. 

## Getting out of the cocoon
Ocassionally I was also thrown into the Visual Mode ring by Vim when trying to paste something using the orthodox `Ctrl+v` but I used to chicken out like a kid running away after finding himself in the ring with Floyd Mayweather. Only recently did I learn how useful the Visual Mode can be, thanks to Sayan who helped me in getting started on using the Visual Mode. Since, then I have been showing it off to my less Vim aware friends :D. I aslo came to know about the nouns inner-word `iw`, paragraph `p`  that can be used with the Visual options `v`, `V` and `Ctrl+v`.

## Final thoughts
So far the journey has been really thrilling and still got to learn a lot. I can vouch for the fact that Vim is really a no bullshit editor and I love using it regularly. I will also be writing a detailed blog on the Vim commands frequently used by me, till then stay safe and stay tuned.
